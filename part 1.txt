I want you to build the full structure and content layout for my personal portfolio website. Use the information from my resume and my previous work experience (Frontend Developer Fresher, MERN familiarity, UI/UX knowledge, GSAP/Framer, project descriptions, and trainer-oriented skills). Create a clear site architecture divided into pages and sections.

The portfolio should be structured with the following mandatory pages and components:

1. Home Page

Hero section with name, role (Frontend Developer • UI/UX Designer), and a clean tagline.

Sub-hero area featuring a short professional summary mixing:

My education

Soft skills

Technologies I specialize in

CTA buttons (Download Resume, Hire Me, View Work)

2. About Page

My complete introduction

A merged summary combining education + soft skills (as requested previously)

Experience overview (trainer role applications, web designer experience, MERN learning journey)

Tools & technologies grid

3. Skills Page

Technical Skills divided into:

Frontend: React, Tailwind, GSAP, Framer Motion, Lenis, JavaScript

Each skill with a short description (trainer-focused)
