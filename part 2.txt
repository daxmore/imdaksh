Build me a highly polished, minimal, premium-feel portfolio website design using React + Tailwind CSS v4 + GSAP + Framer Motion + Lenis. The design must reflect my personal aesthetic: clean, luxury-inspired, minimal, premium, smooth micro-interactions, light theme by default.

Overall Style

Luxury minimalism inspired by high-end branding

Clean whites, soft blacks, muted grays, thin line accents

Generous spacing, elegant typography, subtle shadows

Use free fonts from:

Fontshare (Cal Sans, General Sans, Cabinet Grotesk)

Google Fonts (Inter, Manrope, Poppins optional)

UI should reflect a confident, modern designer/developer identity

Everything should feel “quiet luxury” and smooth

Page Designs

Follow the structure defined in Prompt 1, but apply the following aesthetic directions for each:

Hero Section

Subtle GSAP fade + upward motion

0.3–0.5s delays between text elements

Border-radius 2xl cards where needed

Light floating micro-animations (Framer Motion)

About Section

Split layout: clean portrait image area with soft hover zoom

Text with a premium magazine-like layout

Smooth scroll-trigger animations on each block

Skills Section

Masonry/grid-based card layout

Hover micro-interactions: small lift, soft glow, border animation

GSAP stagger elements on scroll

Projects Section

Full-width layered cards

Image reveals using GSAP clip-path

Titles slide in from the sides

Case study hover preview animations

Services Section

Elegant feature cards with soft transitions

Use minimal icons

Slight motion on hover (5–10px)

Contact Page

Clean, floating input fields

Submit button with magnetic hover effect

Social links with subtle rotation or bounce

Animations & Interactions

Use Lenis smooth scrolling with controlled inertia

GSAP ScrollTrigger for section reveals

Framer Motion for:

Hero transitions

Hover interactions

Component mounting animations

Animation duration guideline: 0.3s–0.5s

Avoid heavy motion; prefer subtle, premium transitions

Micro-Details (Very Important)

Cursor with subtle custom states (optional)

Soft transitions between pages

Preloader with elegant fade-out

Smooth anchor scrolls

Light hover sound (optional)

Output Expectation

Provide a full design concept + flow

Include interactive behaviors for each section

Provide component structure for React

Follow modern UI patterns used in luxury brands

Ensure the site feels like a high-end personal brand for a frontend developer/UI designer.
